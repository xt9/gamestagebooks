# 1.12.2

### 1.0.2
- Fixed an issue where unlocking stages did not work correctly on servers.

### 1.0.1
- Might remove random crashes. They make no sense in the first place but this should fix it.

### 1.0.0
- Now directly runs the silentadd command instead of using the GameStageSaveHandler
- Using silentadd fixes an issue where the gamestage-add event was not firing.
